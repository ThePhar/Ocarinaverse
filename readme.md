# Ocarinaverse

An alternative multi-world implementation for The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time: Randomizer.

## Features

---

+ **Asynchronous play support.** Players in a multi-world game are no longer required to be online at the same time in order to send or receive items from other players. All events get queued server-side so all players that connect will immediately receive their items.

+ **Item and location auto-tracking.** All locations and items get tracked to ensure players always have all their items.

## Supported Platforms

---

Ocarinaverse is only supported to work with BizHawk 2.1+ with the accompanying luabridge file. 

Any system that can run BizHawk can run Ocarinaverse.
